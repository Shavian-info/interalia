Inter Alia is an expanded version of Rasmus Andersson's beautiful open source sans serif typeface, [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter). Inter was specially designed for user interfaces with focus on high legibility of small-to-medium sized text on computer screens.

Inter Alia builds on the features of Inter to add:
- support for [the Shavian alphabet](https://www.shavian.info) with a newly designed set of glyphs, including the letters missing from Unicode (through character variants accessed by inserting 'Variation Selector 1' (U+FE00) after 𐑒, 𐑜, 𐑢, 𐑤, 𐑻, and 𐑺)
- support for old-style figures or numerals, also known as text figures, with both proportional and tabular spacing
- refinements to International Phonetic Alphabet glyphs and other less common glyphs.

Support for additional scripts may be considered in future.

## Design

Inter Alia expands the Inter typeface with additional glyphs and features. Inter is similar to Roboto, San Francisco, Akkurat, Asap, Lucida Grande and other "UI" and "Text" typefaces. Some trade-offs were made in order to make this typeface work really well at small sizes. For details of the underlying approach to designing Inter, please see [https://github.com/rsms/inter](https://github.com/rsms/inter).
